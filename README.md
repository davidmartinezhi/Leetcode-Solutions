==================
There are 3 folders, each folder represents the level of difficulty the leetcode problems has.

* Easy
* Medium
* Hard

Each Difficulty folder contains folder that represents different data structures and algorithms

* Arrays
* Strings
* LinkedLists
* Trees
* Sorting and Searching
* Dynamic Programming
* Design
* Math
* Others

Feel free to add your own personal folder and make sure to include comments that explain your solution, Big O complexity and reasoning. (Make sure to include reference to the problem on leetcode.com)

Reflecting on how you got a solution and making comments in a way that it is easy to understand. Doesn't just helps the community understand your code and reasoning, it helps you retain the knowledge and your reasoning is saved in case you need it later.

Feel free to check and add oppotunities to the folder *Internship Opportunities*
