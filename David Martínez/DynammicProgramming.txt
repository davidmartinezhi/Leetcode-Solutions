What is dynammic programming and how to use it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYquumk4nWw

What is it?
    A way to make your algorithm more efficient by storing some of the intermmediate results

When does it work well?
    When your algorithm has a lot of repetitive computations

Typical 3 steps in dynammic programming.
    1. recursion
    2. store (memoize)
    3. bottom-up

Understand a DP problem:
    when a question has: 
                "Count the total number of ways"
                "Multiple ways of doing things, give me the min and/or max output"
    
    Whenever the concept of "Try all  possible ways: count or the best way"
        In this cases we apply recursion

    Shortcut for Recurrence Relations   
        1. try to represent problem in terms of index
        2. do all possible stuffs on that index according to problem statement
        3. if the questions says "count all ways", sum up all stuff
            if it says count minimum, take min of all stuffs
            same with maximum

Dynammic Programming series

-Those who cannot remember the past, are condomned to repeat it. -DP

Ways to solve it:
    -Tabulation
    -Memoization

Tabulation:
    Bottom-up dynamic programming

Memoization:
    Top-down dynamic programming
