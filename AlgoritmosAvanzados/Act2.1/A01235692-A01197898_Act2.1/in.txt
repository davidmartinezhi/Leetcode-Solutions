crowding
many real world optimisation problems lead to
multimodal domains and require the identification of multiple
optima crowding methods have been developed to maintain
population diversity to investigate many peaks in parallel and
to reduce genetic drift we present the first rigorous runtime
analyses of probabilistic crowding and generalised crowding
embedded in a mu plus one ea in probabilistic crowding the offspring
compete with their parent in a fitness proportional selection
generalised crowding decreases the fitness of the inferior solution
by a scaling factor during selection we consider the bimodal
function twomax and introduce a novel and natural notion
for functions with bounded gradients for a broad range of such
functions we prove that probabilistic crowding needs exponential
time with overwhelming probability to find solutions significantly
closer to any global optimum than those found by random
search even when the fitness function is scaled exponentially
probabilistic crowding still fails badly only if the exponentials
base is linear in the problem size probabilistic crowding becomes
efficient on twomax a similar threshold behaviour holds for
generalised crowding on twomax with respect to the scaling
factor our theoretical results are accompanied by experiments
for twomax showing that the threshold behaviours also apply
to the best fitness found
