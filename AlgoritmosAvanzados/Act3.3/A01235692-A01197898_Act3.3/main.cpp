Act3.2
Implement Dijkstra and Floyd-Warshall algorithms
(Added Dijkstra solution using adjacency list just for the fun of it, it's commented on line 132)

The program must read a number n followed by n x n nonnegative integer values that represent an adjacency matrix of a directed graph.
The first number represents the number of nodes, the following values in the array, the value at position i,j represents the weight of the arc from node i to node j. 
If there is no arc between node i and node j, the value in the array must be -1
